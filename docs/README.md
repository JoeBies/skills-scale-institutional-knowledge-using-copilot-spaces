OctoAcme runs projects through a clear, iterative lifecycle that moves from Initiation to Planning, Execution, Release, and Close. Core artifacts include a Project One-pager (problem, goals, and measurable success criteria), a prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria, a Risk Register, and a project board that maps work through Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done. Decision gates are used at Initiation and before major releases to confirm stakeholder alignment and team availability.

Workflows emphasize small, testable increments and well-defined handoffs. Backlog items follow a template (title, description, acceptance criteria, priority, estimate, owner) and are pulled into iterations only when they meet the Definition of Done. The team uses timeboxed sprint ceremonies (planning, daily standups, demos/reviews, and retrospectives) and a pull request workflow that prefers small PRs, requires CI (tests, linting, security scans) to pass before review, and links PRs to the related issue and acceptance criteria.

Roles and communication are explicit: Product Managers own outcomes and prioritize the backlog, Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder communication, Developers implement and test features, and QA validates acceptance criteria and runs manual checks when needed. Communication cadence includes daily standups for team triage, regular PM/PdM syncs, weekly or milestone-based stakeholder updates, and templated status reports. Clear escalation paths (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) and the use of a single source-of-truth project README or release doc help keep stakeholders aligned.

Quality assurance is integrated into delivery: unit and integration tests are required for new logic, end-to-end smoke tests validate critical flows before release, automated security scanning runs in CI, and manual QA covers acceptance testing where necessary. Releases follow a checklist (staging verification, smoke tests, automated deployment when possible, post-deploy verification, and a documented rollback plan). Continuous improvement is enforced via regular retrospectives that produce prioritized action items tracked back into the backlog.
